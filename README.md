# Installation

npm install -g @blinkmobile/cli @blinkmobile/bm-profile

# Credentials Profile Management

This is a utility for use with our [CLI](https://github.com/blinkmobile/cli)

It handles setting the Credentials profile name at a project level, and also
creating and updating profiles.

NOTE: In the unlikely circumstance that you have a large credentials file 
(> 16Kb) then it is recommended that you manually update the file.

See the [docs folder](docs/) for usage information.
